Spyglass is a search engine for *your* web, crawling and indexing documents that you
care about and making them available to you through a *simple* & *fast* interface.


## How does it know what you care about?
You can add different lenses that clue the application into what you want.

* Interested in cooking & recipes? Add the "recipe" lens which will go index a
  curated set of websites with high quality recipes.
* Interested in the Rust programming language? Add the "rustlang" lens which will
  index the Rust book, rust docs, and crate.io
* Want a knowledge base? Add the "wiki" lense to narrow down your search to only
  pages from Wikipedia.
